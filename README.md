A PHP MVC framework emphasizing ease for developers while keeping it robust and rich.

I started this quite a long time ago but never get to finish it. I wanted a PHP framework to be simple and yet robust with many features out of the box. I must admit I am not very experienced in it and so that is why this code needs to be changed a lot before extending anything. I wanted to make a PHP framework for small websites, Where you need a light weight and eaesy framework. By easy I mean easy for developers, I wanted to eliminate the coding necessaties CakePHP and CodeIgniter wants a developer to accomplish. 

I am putting this on github so other developers of interest can be a part of this. I hope we can get something here which will help million of people and especially the developers to get their thing done in minimum amout of time.

By developer ease I mean, If you see the controller structure, All you need to do is declare a class and extend it with the base controller class; you are not required to call any file load like in CakePHP (APP::USES) or whatever. Similarly you don't need to declare a model array, nor you need to load a Database through function to use it like in codeignitor, With that said, I am not sure if they work like this in their current versions because I have moved to .NET and python now (crazy combination but ...) .

So I believe you got the point, This is pretty much the scratch so If you join, you can get your own point going on here. Maybe using namespaces, may be getting this to the next level.

I hope I will get a good response, Please feel free to send me a message.
